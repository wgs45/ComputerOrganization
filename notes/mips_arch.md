# Introduction to MIPS Processor Architecture

# MIPS Register File

32 bits (one word, one addressable) \* 32 units. Which is located inside the CPU to accessing the file efficiently (Fewer clock cycles). Each register stores the value of a variable. Register represented like this: $t0

# Memory

- 4GB. Each memory location is 8bits (byte addressable).
- RAM is located externally.
- The greater the no. of clock cycles, the greater the access time.
- Only access memory when needed to load data from memory into registers
- Or store data into the memory from registers.

# MIPS Instructions.

There are 3 types of MIPS Instructions:

- R type
- I type
- J type
